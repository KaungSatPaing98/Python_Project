# CP1404 Assignment 1 - Travel Tracker
Assignment 1 for CP1404/CP5632, IT@JCU

By: **your name here**  

This repo contains starter files including a Python file and two CSV files.  
(`temp.csv` is to copy from in case you delete the contents of `places.csv` and want the original data back).  
**Edit this README file**, replacing this paragraph with your own assignment name and details.  
At the end of the project, complete the very brief project reflection below by answering the questions (replace the `answer...` parts).  
Note: If you use the free WakaTime service on your own machine, you can track exactly how long you spent in code (over one week).

1. How long did the entire assignment 1 project take you?
> 1 week

2. What do you plan to do  differently in your development process for assignment 2?
> Planning  before I start coding, take some time to plan  approach. Break down the problem into smaller parts and create a flowchart or pseudocode to help me visualize the solution.
 Write modular code that is easy to read and maintain. Use functions and classes to break down your code into smaller, reusable parts. This can make my code more organized, easier to debug, and improve its performance.
